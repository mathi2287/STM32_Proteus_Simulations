Project: Multi-Button Interrupt Controlled LED System using STM32F401RE

Description:
This embedded systems project demonstrates the use of External Interrupts (EXTI) on the STM32F401RE microcontroller to control multiple LEDs using push buttons. Each push button is configured on a GPIO pin (PB0, PB1, PB9, PB10) and is mapped to a specific EXTI line (EXTI0, EXTI1, EXTI9, EXTI10). When a button is pressed, it triggers an interrupt service routine (ISR) that lights up or toggles a corresponding LED (PA0, PA1, PA2, PA3).

The project includes:
- Initializing GPIO pins for 4 LEDs as output.
- Initializing GPIO pins for 4 push buttons as input with internal pull-down resistors.
- Configuring SYSCFG EXTICR to map GPIOB pins to EXTI lines.
- Enabling EXTI lines with falling edge trigger detection.
- Writing ISRs for each EXTI to blink or toggle an LED.

This project is useful to understand:
- GPIO input/output control
- External interrupts and their configuration
- NVIC interrupt handling
- Basic embedded C programming for STM32

Tools Used:
- STM32F401RE Nucleo Board
- STM32CubeIDE
- Proteus 8 (for circuit simulation)
- 4 Push Buttons (connected to PB0, PB1, PB9, PB10)
- 4 LEDs (connected to PA0, PA1, PA2, PA3)

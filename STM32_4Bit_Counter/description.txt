Tools Requirements:
  - Proteus 8 (Hardware Simulation)
  - STM32CubeIDE (Convert Embedded C to .Hex)

Hardware Used:
  - STM32F4 Nucleo board (F401RE or F411RE)
  - 4 LEDs (connected to GPIO output pins) with Current limiting resistor
  - 1 Push Button (connected to GPIO input pin with pull-down)

Working Principle:
  - Every time the button is pressed, the counter increases by 1.
  - The 4 output pins (connected to LEDs) show the binary representation of the current counter value.
  - After reaching 15 (0b1111), it wraps back to 0 (0b0000).

# STM32_Simulations
Hello, Folks!  
All projects I have uploaded are based on the **ARM Cortex-M4** series of microcontrollers, specifically the **STM32F401Rx** family.

# Tools & Development Environment

- **MCU**: STM32F401xx (Cortex-M4, up to 84 MHz)
- **IDE**: STM32CubeIDE, Arduino IDE (for Arduino interfacing)
- **Libraries**: STM32F4xx
- **Simulation**: Proteus, STM32CubeMX code generation

# üìÅ Project Highlights

Each simulation demonstrates a key concept or peripheral in STM32 embedded development:

- **UART/I2C/SPI Communication**
- **GPIO Control**
- **Timers & PWM**
- **ADC/DAC** 
- **NVIC & Interrupts**
- **External Modules** 

# üìö Requirements

- STM32CubeIDE or Keil (with proper packs)
- Proteus 8+ (for simulation)

# üí¨ Contribution & Feedback

*Microcontroller Used:* STM32F401RE with STM32CubeIDE a Bare metal program

*GPIO Configuration:* 
Port A (PA0–PA3) configured as output to control 4 LEDs.

Port B (PB0–PB3) configured as input in Open-Drain mode with Pull-Down resistors for 4 push buttons.

Default Button State:

Pull-down keeps PBx pins at logic LOW (0) when button is not pressed.

Pressing the button connects the pin to HIGH (1).

Working Logic:

Each button press toggles its respective LED:

PB0 → PA0

PB1 → PA1

PB2 → PA2

PB3 → PA3

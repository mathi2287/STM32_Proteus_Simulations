*Microcontroller Used:* STM32F401RE with STM32CubeIDE a Bare metal program

*GPIO Configuration:* 
1. Port A (PA0–PA3) configured as output to control 4 LEDs.
2. Port B (PB0–PB3) configured as input in Open-Drain mode with Pull-Down resistors for 4 push buttons.

*Default Button State:*
1. Pull-down keeps PBx pins at logic LOW (0) when button is not pressed.
2. Pressing the button connects the pin to HIGH (1).

*Working Logic:*
1. Each button press toggles its respective LED:
    PB0 → PA0
    PB1 → PA1
    PB2 → PA2
    PB3 → PA3
2. Learning Outcome: Practiced GPIO input/output, pull-downs, open-drain config, LED control, and button logic.
